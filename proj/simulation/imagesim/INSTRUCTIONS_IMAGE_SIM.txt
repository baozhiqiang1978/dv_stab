How to load and store images from/to simulated DRAM
---------------------------------------------------
R.Willenberg - Jan 19, 2012
Many thanks to Michael Lee for the 'dramtoraw' and 'rawtodram' binary tools

- LINUX ONLY, SORRY -

NOTE A: This is just for simulation. You cannot load/store images from/to the board this way.

NOTE B: This tool inputs and outputs images of type PNG of size 1024x480. The video input
        component stores 720x480 images into RAM, and the video output component reads 640x480
        images. However, both components use pixel data that is power-of-two aligned per line,
        which is why lines in memory are 1024 pixel (or 4096 byte) long

NOTE C: Even on a 512MB system, only the lower 256MB can be loaded and stored from/to

USAGE EXAMPLE:

1. Make sure that the tool suite "ImageMagick" is installed:
     sudo apt-get install imagemagick

2. Setup a Microblaze design with DDR-RAM

3. Add a Software project (Check 'Init BRAMs') with invert_test.c as the source

4. Generate simulation files and start the simulator

3. copy the folder "imagesim" from the ZIP into your project subdirectory /simulation/

4. Make sure the simulation has been compiled and started with the DRAM model.

5. Load an image into memory by using this command on the Modelsim console:
     do ../imagesim/loadimagedata.do 0x01000000 input.png

   NOTE: The start address of the image is always relative to the DRAM base address, so if the
         DRAM starts at 0x90000000, the image is loaded to 0x91000000.

6. Run the simulator for about 172 ms for inverting the full image (or less for inverting a
   part of the image).

7. Store the inverted image into the /imagesim/ folder with
     do ../imagesim/saveimagedata.do 0x02000000 output.png

8. Compare 'input.png' and 'output.png' in /imagesim/

SIDE NOTE: As you see, reading and writing an image in single words takes very long (172 ms
           means a frame rate of 5.7/s). For any serious processing, you will have to use
           burst-mode access to the Multi-ported Memory Controller.
