Real Time Digital Video Stabilization

  Project for ECE532S 2012 at the University of Toronto by:

    Ming Liu
    Chung Peng (Charles) Huang
    Kevin Murray


This project is targeted at a Xilinx Virtex 2 Pro FPGA (XC2VP30), 
as part of the XUPV2 development board.

The stabilization algorithm is based off of the Gray Coded 
Bit Plane (GCBP) method presented in:

    S. J. Ko, S.H. Lee, and K.H. Lee, “Digital Image Stabilizing 
    Algorithms Based on Bit-Plane Matching”, in IEEE Trans. On 
    Consumer Electronics, Vol. 44, no.3, Aug. 1998, pp.617-622.
